I need this to be what happens when customers login (see 2 attached sheets):

a. First screen: Are you an individual or entity?

b. If individual: see attached--it needs to be converted with docusign/checking boxes to make it easier. Every field that has an asterisk next to it should be required.

1. The individual fills in his info (all info that wasn't filled in during registration must be filled in)
2. The individual signals that he is either an accredited investor (4 possible choices) or sophisticated investor (1 possible choice)--check boxes 
3. The individual prints and signs name, and dates agreement
4. The questionnaire is securely emailed to rich@goralaw.com and daniel@coinflip.tech.

b2. If entity
1. The entity fills in its info (asterisks are necessary)
2. The entity selects option "a-k," or "other purchasers." If the entity selects k, it needs to fill in additional info.--check boxes
3. Entity signs and dates agreement via a representative of the entity.
4. The questionnaire is securely emailed to rich@goralaw.com and daniel@coinflip.tech

c. Sale page--we give them an ethereum/bitcoin address to send funds to, and we send flipcoin to their preferred address in return for the amount they send. Can we have a screen that converts dollars to ethereum/bitcoin? So if they write "100 dollars", it gives them the amount of btc/eth to send. Could we readjust the ethereum required at the beginning of each transaction? I think we can probably just use Coinbase/Bitstamp's price API and it would be simple.
