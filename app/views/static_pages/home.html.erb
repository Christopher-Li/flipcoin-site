			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="paragraph">
					We are now excited to offer FlipCoin (ATM) tokens to our dedicated supporters. They
					will be treated as a membership token that will provide benefits for those own
					it, with access to significant discounts, consulting, crypto networking events,
					and educational literature/videos created by CoinFlip (among other things).  
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					The two biggest draws for purchasing FlipCoin are for customers and potential business partners.  Paying $100 grants purchasers a <span class="bold">lifetime discount on all CoinFlip domestic wire (2% fee) and ATM (3.5% fee) purchases.  These fee are roughly 1/5 of what some of our competitors charge.</span>  Paying $5,000 grants aspiring ATM operators the right to <span class="bold">waive CoinFlip's usual $10,000 upfront fee for initial set up, brand licensing, managed tech support, customer service assistance, and compliance consulting.</span>
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					Purchasing these tokens allows for a mutualistic relationship between the buyer and our company. The buyer pays upfront in order to help us expand our operations and make the token more useful, and in return he or she receives an unheard-of discount that can pay for itself in as little as one purchase, or one year in business.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					Your funds will also be used to generate adoption in the crypto sphere as a whole, because our company seeks to make crypto more accessible to the average consumer via a familiar purchasing model (an ATM) with a familiar asset (cash).

			<h2 class="subsection-header">What is CoinFlip?</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="paragraph">At <a href="http://www.coinflip.tech" target="_blank" class="link">CoinFlip</a>, we feel that the exchange of different coins (like bitcoin and
				ether) into fiat currency should be a seamless and intuitive process. We are an
				established company in the Midwest that adheres to Know Your Customer
				and Anti-Money Laundering compliance protocols. Our goal is to create a
				global network of cryptocurrency ATMs that allow users to easily convert their
				highly-available fiat currency into relatively unobtainable digital assets and
				vice versa.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">While the cryptocurrency ATM network is not as expansive as the online
				exchanges, ATMs do provide a location where users can take advantage of a
				quick registration process and the convenience of being able to exchange cash
				for cryptocurrencies in a matter of minutes.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Speed, convenience of acquisition, and a fair price are three sought-after
				components of cryptocurrency exchanges. In order to increase general
				awareness and encourage mass adoption, these facets need to be optimized.
				These are core values at CoinFlip as we are actively trying to expand the ATM
				network across the country and eventually, the globe. People should be able
				to make bitcoin and other cryptocurrency purchases without hassle and time
				constraints. The easier it is to freely exchange fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
				versa, the faster the overall crypto sphere will grow.</p>

						“As a sophisticated trader, my top two concerns entering the crypto space are security and a good deal. CoinFlip’s team has the best prices in the cash-to-crypto game by far; I couldn’t believe it when I saw one of their competitors charging north of a 15% mark up. I trust the CoinFlip team, and FlipCoin will pay for itself many times over in a very short period of time. A heavy discount off of the lowest fees simply can’t be beat.”
